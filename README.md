# Cat Api project

This project uses the Cat api found at this link: https://thecatapi.com/

The goal is to display the top 5 cats that rank highest in the following criteria, combined:
1. Dog friendly
2. Child friendly
3. Stranger friendly

The technologies used were:
- javascript
- expressJS
- Axios
- ejs
- dotenv
- nodemon

Note: In order to test this project, you will need your own developer api key from the cat api website, and create a .env file to hold this key. For security reasons this api key is not pushed to github.

## Getting started

In order to start this project, run "npm i", which will install all npm packages required. Afterwards, run "npm run devStart".
